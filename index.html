    <P class="b">Story: The plot is simple, weak and predictable, but still watchable for once. It blends emotional drama with full-throttle action, a package rarely seen in recent years. Simbuâ€™s performance is terrifying in the best sense, commanding and intense, almost taking center stage throughout the film, while Kamal Haasan appears more as the second lead. The stunt choreography, led by the talented AnbuArivu duo (of Vikram fame), is explosive and on point. Trisha, Abhirami, and Aishwarya Lekshmi deliver s</P>
